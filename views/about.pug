            | I'm Dave, I work hard and play easy.
            | Family circumstance took me from Denver, where I was the GM of a music venue, to the Pacific Northwest where I have 
            | learned to code. I've been working at a small computer store, where we sell and repair Apple products. It has provided 
            | me the opportunity to discover the tech consumer's needs and wants, which aids my goal of creating and maintaining 
            | accessible websites for everyone.

            | I have a strong foundation in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Python. I am experienced in a moderate amount of tools including 
            | React, Express, Django, and jQuery. I have an understanding of object-oriented programing concepts and can navigate the 
            | asynchronous nature of JavaScript.

            | I am an eager learner and love to solve problems. My aim is set on becoming an expert in all things cyber security. I 
            | want to help protect our representations online as it becomes essential to how we communicate and interact. I believe 
            | one of the largest existential threats we face comes from bad actors online. I want to be a a good guy fighting against 
            | that threat.
