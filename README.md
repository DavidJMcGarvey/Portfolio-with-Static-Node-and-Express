Welcome to my personal portfolio of projects! Where you come for the collection of projects written in both JavaScript and Python, but you stay for the custom error message displaying a cool dog.

## Application Description and Goals:

To run: 
1. Download dependencies using **npm install** in your Terminal or CLI.
2. Once depencies are installed, type **npm start** in your Terminal or CLI to start up the server. 
3. Go to **localhost:3000** in a web broswer to access the home page of the website. 

Or simply:
1. Go to https://david-mcgarvey-portfolio.herokuapp.com/

**BASIC FEATURES**

Using the Express framework and Pug templating, this web site displays a collection of projects that reflect my skills as a developer. From the home page, users can scroll through my projects. Clicking on a project thumbnail brings user to a page with further detail and links for said project. There is also an **about** page that gives a little background into my own coding journey and gives hopeful employers a snapshot of the employee I could be for them. 

**EXTRA FEATURES**
- Easy to start: The package.json initalization allows user to simply type **npm start** from the Terminal or CLI while in the project directory to run the web app. 
- Custom Error: A custom error template give users a better experience with a clear way to return to the home page when something goes wrong
- Custom Styling: At the bottom of **styles.css**, custom CSS styles were added to the pre-existing project CSS. 

## Technologies:

1. JavaScript
